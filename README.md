A small utility that scans a given directory, that contains Movies and TV Shows, and tries to fetch information about them from online APIs.
The fetched information is then stored in a Local SQLite Database, for later usages. 

Usage :- 
```
python run.py <directory_path>
```

#### Dependencies :-
- sqlite3
- requests
- terminaltables
- Network Connection :sweat_smile: 

TODO :
- [ ] Make it argument driven
- [ ] Complete the Database Reader program
- [ ] Add several APIs for better success rate
- [ ] Merge the reader and writer programs
